# About this repo
The concept of blogging was never something very appeling to me, but in the last few months since i started persuing my C.S Degree I started to find a way to organize my thoughts and some of my experiences as a aspiring Software Developer

As I develop my skills in web/mobile development I plan to create my own blogging website so I can share more of myself while doing what I like the most, coding :D!

This is public and I'm a non-native english speaker and although I consider myself fluent and able to communicate with no challange I may commit grammar errors. 
So if you find any typos or grammar errors or ways that I could improve my sentences feel free to correct me and contribute!
